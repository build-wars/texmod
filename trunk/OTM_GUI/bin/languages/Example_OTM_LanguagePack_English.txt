If you have created a language package and would like to add to the officially download, please send it to me.
Email address and support can be found at http://code.google.com/p/texmod/  


The file name must match the wildcard OTM_LanguagePack_NAMEOFLANGUAGE.txt
Format of an entry is divided into 3 parts: 1) Keyword directly followed by a colon, 2) message, and 3) end symbol "|"
Restriction of the the message: do not use "|" within a message!!

You can also use utf-16LE encoding, but you have to label the file as OTM_LanguagePackU_NAMEOFLANGUAGE.txt

comments must start with an "#" and must end with |

e.g.

#

this is a comment

|

Example:

Keyword:

Message1 line1
Message1 line2

|

Keyword2:Message2|
Keyword3:Message3 line1
Message3 line2|


There is no need to include all keywords, since English is loaded each time as default and afterwards the entries are replaced.
English itself is compiled into the OTM_GUI.exe, thus there exists no OTM_LanguagePack_English.txt.

The following list is an example of how an English package would look like (maybe not all keywords are present).
